- 👋 Hi, this is BrainLink official github site, we will share all information here.

- 👀 BrainLink is an open platform to allow everyone to publish tasks and everyone can help others by solving problems, control remote machines or else, when you help
others you will get rewards (BrainLink Token), it utilizes the brain power from all over the world to solve difficult problems or time consuming problems, everyone can
public problems and can also help others when you are free.

- 🌱 What you can do on BrainLink:
   - Ask and answer questions
   - Monitor tasks (like monitor email/news/broadcast) and notify
   - Control remote machine thru camera(cars/excavators/AI-dogwalker etc)

- 💞️ How it works:
       BrainLink will act as a platform, it defines different interface with which user can customize the tasks and publish(you need BrainLink token to publish, token link will be publish later), once it published other users can search and see the
   on the app(Android/IOS), if the user is interested in the task he can join the workshop and do the job, one task will have one workshop, every workshop will request at least
   3 workers to start, every worker will contribute his result or control the machine, based on the results from different worker, the most similar will be treated as correct
   result and will give rewards to the worker made correct result, the worker who made wrong result will not get reward and will get level down, once his level is down to a
   threshhold he cannot join any workshop for a defined time, so every worker should try to provide the best result. Of course the worker in same workshop does not know each
   other, so user cannot cheat by forming a group.

- 📫 What to expect:
   BrainLink will be an open source platform, we welcome everyone to contribute to it, we also welcome hardware manufacture to integrate with our system, include but limited
   to:
   Vehicle control system
   Automatic dog walker
   Remote machine
   Remote Camera
